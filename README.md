Authentication and authorization (JWT Authentication)</br>
Handling and logging errors the right way</br>
Sending email to client for confirmation email and reset password </br>
Application deployment with Heroku</br>
saving  Images on buffer and uploading on Cloud service</br>
Secure Node, Express, Mongo and React application on the front-end and back-end using bcrypt and JSON Web Tokens</br>

# Back end’s library:

Node.js v10  (Node.js, or Node, is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is ideal for building highly-scalable, data-intensive backend services (APIs) that power your client’s apps (web or mobile apps).)</br>
Express js v4.16 (Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.)</br>
MongoDB (MongoDB is an open source database management system (DBMS) that uses a document-oriented database model which supports various forms of data. ... Instead of using tables and rows as in relational databases, the MongoDB architecture is made up of collections and documents.)</br>
Mongoose js v5 (Mongoose is an object data modeling (ODM) library that provides a rigorous modeling environment for your data, enforcing structure as needed while still maintaining the flexibility that makes MongoDB powerful)</br>
Nodemailer v4.6 (Nodemailer is a module for Node.js applications to allow easy as cake email sending)</br>
Multer (Multer is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files.)</br>
node.bcrypt.js (bcrypt is a password hashing function)</br>
jsonwebtoken (JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.Here are some scenarios where JSON Web Tokens are useful:Authorization, Information Exchange)</br>
cloudinary (a cloud-based image and video management solution. It enables users to upload, store, manage, manipulate and deliver images and video for websites and apps.)</br>
Pug template (Pug.js is a HTML templating engine, which means you can write much simpler Pug code, which Pug compiler will compile into HTML code, that browser can understand. ... We can make an email template using Pug with variables that can be changed based on user to whom we are sending that email.)</br>
